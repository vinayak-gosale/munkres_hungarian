The Simplest implementation of Munkres Hungarian Algorithm

Concept:
Hungarian Algorithm using inbuild python or scipy and numpy as much as possible

What is Hungarian Algorithm?
Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm

Why use scipy and numpy implementations?
No point in re-inventing the wheel. 
The libraries are more optimised than whatever code I will write. Use the best that is available.

Please feel free to suggest any improvements.
